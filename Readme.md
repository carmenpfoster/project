## Abstract 
An important factor, which affects environmental conditions of animals, is weather. A few studies show that wild boar decrease their movement at low temperatures and increase their movement in late summer. Thus, this project will analyse the connection between weather and wild boar movement, to reassure that there are effects of weather on wild boar movement. 

## Research Questions
<!-- (50-60 words) -->

## Results / products
As a few studies already found out with their wild boar movement data, we expect that weather affects the wild boar movement (Thurfjell et al. 2014; Lemel, 1999; Morell et al. 2015). These effects are dependent on time and season of day (Thurjfell, 2014: 470). Possibly, the visualization will show the difference between summer and winter. Overall wild boar tend to increase their movement speed with high temperatures. 

## Data
We will use the provided wild boar movement data. Additionally, we will use/need weather data from the study area from wild boar movement data. We have already asked Nils if this is possible. He reassured that, there is a possibility to get those weather data. But firstly, he has to prepare those data so that it can be used. 

## Analytical concepts
<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## R concepts
<!-- Which R concepts, functions, packages will you mainly use. What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## Risk analysis
<!-- What could be the biggest challenges/problems you might face? What is your plan B? -->

## Questions? 
<!-- Which questions would you like to discuss at the coaching session? -->
If there are weather data for our project and if it is available and suitable?
