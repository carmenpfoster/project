## Abstract 
An important factor, which affects environmental conditions of animals, is weather. A few studies show that wild boar decrease their movement at low temperatures and increase their movement in late summer. Thus, this project will analyse the connection between weather and wild boar movement, to reassure that there are effects of weather on wild boar movement. 

## Research Questions
Is there a seasonal difference in the wild boar moving pattern (clustering vs moving but also regarding the location and properties of their habitat)?
<!-- (50-60 words) -->

## Results / products
As a few studies already found out with their wild boar movement data, we expect that weather affects the wild boar movement (Thurfjell et al. 2014; Lemel, 1999; Morell et al. 2015). These effects are dependent on time and season of day (Thurjfell, 2014: 470). Possibly, the visualization will show the difference between summer and winter. Overall wild boar tend to increase their movement speed with high temperatures. 

## Data
We will use the provided wild boar movement data. Additionally, we will use/need weather data from the study area from wild boar movement data. We have already asked Nils if this is possible. He reassured that, there is a possibility to get those weather data. But firstly, he has to prepare those data so that it can be used. Additionally the Arealstatistik will be used to see whether the use of space changes with the weather.

## Analytical concepts

<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## R concepts
We think that we mainly will use dplyr, tidyverse, sf, lubridate. For the homerange analysis, a suitable package would be "adehabitatHR". Depending on how the weather data is structured some additional packages might be applied.

## Risk analysis
<!-- What could be the biggest challenges/problems you might face? What is your plan B? -->

## Questions? 
<!-- Which questions would you like to discuss at the coaching session? -->
If there are weather data for our project and if it is available and suitable?
